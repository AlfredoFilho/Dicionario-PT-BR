#### How was this file created?
- As a first base I used the [IntelliJ dictionary](https://github.com/rafaelsc/IntelliJ.Portuguese.Brazil.Dictionary)
- Web scraping to get some popular [Brazilian Portuguese verbs](https://www.conjugacao.com.br/verbos-populares/)
- [Spacy](https://spacy.io/models/pt#pt_core_news_sm) to separate all verbs in the infinitive tense 
    - Web scraping again to conjugate in all verb tenses with the website [https://www.conjugacao.com.br/](https://www.conjugacao.com.br/)
